This workflow guides you through creating a well-structured README.md file for your project.

## Prerequisites

## Steps

1. **Initialize README**

   ```

2. **Add Basic Structure**
   Add the following sections to your README.md:
   ```markdown
   # Project Title
   
   [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
