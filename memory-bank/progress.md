# Project Progress

*This document tracks the overall status of the project, what's completed, what remains, known issues, and the evolution of key decisions.*

**Status Overview:**

*   **Current State:** The application implements the core CAPA workflow with AI integration. A major refactoring of the AI knowledge base system has been completed based on user feedback, aiming for improved relevance, token optimization, and clearer data structure.
*   **What Works (Inferred & Recently Enhanced):**
    *   Core CAPA workflow (issue creation, Gemba, RCA, Action Plan, Evidence, Closure).
    *   AI-powered suggestions for RCA and Action Plans.
    *   **Refactored AI Knowledge System (Flattened Structure - Final):**
        *   `AIKnowledgeBase` table uses dedicated columns (`adjusted_whys_json`, `adjusted_temporary_actions_json`, `adjusted_preventive_actions_json`). Migration script created and executed successfully.
        *   `rca_adjustment` entries store the user-adjusted 5 Whys list in `adjusted_whys_json`.
        *   `action_plan_adjustment` entries store simplified lists of action text strings in `adjusted_temporary_actions_json` / `adjusted_preventive_actions_json`, AND store the associated 5 Whys list (from the CAPA's `RootCause`) in `adjusted_whys_json`.
        *   `ai_learning.py` updated to store data correctly in the new structure.
        *   `get_relevant_rca_knowledge` retrieves `adjusted_whys_json` based on machine name and issue description match.
        *   `get_relevant_action_plan_knowledge` correctly filters `action_plan_adjustment` entries based on machine name, issue description, and matching `adjusted_whys_json` against the current CAPA's 5 Whys. It returns the simplified action plan lists.
        *   `ai_service.py` updated to use the final knowledge structure and retrieval functions in prompts.
    *   PDF report generation.
    *   File uploads and serving.
    *   Basic status tracking.
*   **What's Left to Build (Potential Areas):**
    *   **Testing:** Thorough end-to-end testing of the refactored AI suggestion and learning workflows is CRITICAL.
    *   **Advanced Text Matching:** The current "matching issue description" uses substring matching (`LIKE %...%`). More advanced NLP techniques could be explored.
    *   **5 Whys Matching Refinement:** The current 5 Whys matching uses sorted list comparison. String similarity metrics could provide more flexibility.
    *   **User Interface/Experience (UI/UX):** General review and refinement.
    *   **Error Handling:** Continued focus on robust error handling.
    *   **Security, Formal Testing (Unit/Integration), Deployment Prep:** Standard ongoing concerns.
    *   **Database Migrations:** Consider adopting a formal migration tool like Alembic.
*   **Known Issues/Bugs (Potential):**
    *   The effectiveness and accuracy of the new filtering and data structure need validation through testing.
    *   Potential edge cases in data migration or JSON parsing (though the script reported success).
*   **Decision Log (Recent Additions):**
    *   Decision to refactor `AIKnowledgeBase` to use dedicated columns for learned data (`adjusted_..._json`) instead of a single JSON blob.
    *   Decision to store the associated 5 Whys (`adjusted_whys_json`) within `action_plan_adjustment` entries to enable direct filtering.
    *   Decision to simplify stored action plan data to only include lists of action text strings.
    *   Revised logic for `get_relevant_action_plan_knowledge` to directly filter action plan entries based on context and 5 Whys match.
    *   Continued use of custom Python scripts for database migrations.

*(This progress assessment reflects the latest refactoring. Please review and update.)*
